This is a simple Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking a 3×3 grid with "X" and "O". The first player to align three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Key features:

Interactive 3×3 game board

Real-time tracking of player turns

Automatic winner and draw detection

Option to restart the game

Clean and reusable React components

This project demonstrates the use of React state management, array mapping, and conditional rendering to build a classic game interface.
